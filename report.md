Report for a 3-year-old Siberian Husky with Loss of Appetite

   ### Diagnosis
     * Overview: The case is of a 3-year-old Siberian Husky dog that has exhibited a loss of appetite. Given the absence of previous medical records, various conditions concerning gastrointestinal systems, liver disorders due to parasitic infections, and Sentinel Serosal Fibroplasia / Sclerosis Codonopsis (Fasciolopsis Buski Infestation) must be considered with access to fresh or stagnant water bodies.
     * Details:
      - Gastrointestinal Dilation & Volvulus (GDV) and related gastrointestinal disorders such as Megacolon, Pancreatitis, etc.
           ++ Likely causes may include indigestion caused by consuming foreign objects or bloat due to overeating or rapid changes in diet or a congenital condition.
      - Sentinel Serosal Fibroplasia / Sclerosis Codonopsis (Fasciolopsis Buski Infestation)
            ++ This condition may be transmitted through contaminated water if the dog uses lakes, streams, ponds or has been to areas with improper waste disposal.

   ### Treatment Options
   #### GDV & associated gastrointestinal conditions:
     a. Surgical intervention using either Laparoscopic assistance (for smaller cases or when preserving abdominal contents) or traditional surgical methods
     b. Pain Management utilizing Carprofen, Meloxicam, opioids, and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
       - Note: A consultation with the attending veterinarian is important to determine which pain management drug to primarily use based on the dog's prior responses if history exists.
     c. Fluids and electrolyte restoration to recover hydration using lactated ring solutions, normal saline solution (0.9%), or alternatives recommended by a veterinary professional in severe cases.
     d. Antibacterials such as azithromycin, cefazolin, or enrofloxacin help combat infections and prevent the spread of underlying pathogens.
     e. Administer antiemetics: Maropitant and Ondansetron are suggested for relieving and inhibiting nausea caused by the underlying disorders. For conditions demanding extended treatment, further discussions with a specialized veterinary professional should be scheduled.

   #### Fasciolopsis Buski Infestation Treatment Plan:
     a. Employ Praziquantel to combat tapeworm infections, which may need repeated applications if continuous occurrences persist. Consult a licensed veterinarian about proper administration procedures and appropriate dosages for the specified husky breed.
     b. Reevaluate or advise nutritional guidelines enhancement, as required, promoting recovery. Ensure nutritious food enriched in fiber, proteins, carbs, fats, and vitamins in consultation with a veterinarian. This might be beneficial to support the damaged liver throughout convalescence phase.
